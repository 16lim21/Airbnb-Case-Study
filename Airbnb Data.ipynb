The house was just as it is pictured, very fresh and clean.  The neigborhood is fantastic, whether you want Chinese, Italian or simply some milk- all of it is within 2 minutes walking.

The apartment was wonderful, perfect for a small family and would work well for a group of friends too.  Parking is excellent and the backyard is a special treat.  The house was just as it is pictured, very fresh and clean.  The neigborhood is fantastic, whether you want Chinese, Italian or simply some milk- all of it is within 2 minutes walking.  My only concern about leaving this review is that this apartment will always be booked and I won&#x27;t get to stay again.  This will be our first choice any time we are headed to NYC.  Thank you Christian for making our week in NYC a great one!\r",
