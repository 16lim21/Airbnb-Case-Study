This was done as part of a case study project for LionBase. The prompt was:

Using historical NYC data from AirBnB, identify a problem or opportunity and
discuss how you would address it. The main goal is to deliver analytical insights
backed by real data and models. You can choose how much data to use, what kind
of data to use, and whether or not you want to bring in outside data. Clearly state
and justify any assumptions you make. When thinking about a problem or
opportunity, think about how it could add actual business value.

Included in the github is a python script and a jupyter notebook. Data JSON files should already be included in the repository, but if you want to reload data, first run all cells in the jupyter notebook, then run the airbnb.py script. When the terminal command prompts if you have processesed the neighborhood files yet, say no, and answer the remaining questions.
